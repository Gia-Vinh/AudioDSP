    "# Exercise 5: Sinusoidal model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will experiment with the sinusoidal model, measuring and tracking sinusoids in different kinds of audio signals. You will use the sinusoidal model to analyze short synthetic sounds with the goal to better understand various aspects of sinusoid estimation and tracking. You will experiment with different parameters and enhancements of the sinusoidal modeling approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are five parts in this exercise: 1) Minimizing the frequency estimation error of a sinusoid, 2) Tracking a two component chirp, 3) Tracking sinusoids of different amplitudes, 4) Tracking sinusoids using the phase spectrum, and 5) Sinusoidal modeling of a multicomponent signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "__Chirp signals:__\n",
    "A chirp is a signal whose frequency varies with time. In an up-chirp, the frequency increases in time. In Part 2 of the exercise, we will use a synthetically generated linear chirp with two frequency components. The frequency components are very close to each other and to resolve the two components, you need to use a large window. However, the frequency of a chirp continuously changes, which implies that we need a shorter window for analysis to capture this continuously changing frequency. Hence, there exists a tradeoff between the best set of sinusoidal analysis parameters to achieve a good tracking of the two components of the chirp. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Sinusoidal modeling and sine tracking:__ \n",
    "Sinusoidal modeling aims to model each frame of audio with a set of sinusoids, from which we can reconstruct the input audio with minimum reconstruction error. The basic peak detection task performed in the spectrum of a frame can be enhanced in many ways to obtain the most compact representation possible and the most meaningful one for a particular task. One of the enhancements implemented in sms-tools is the tracking of the estimated sinusoids over time. In sounds with stable notes, the sinusoids tend to last over several frames and this can be used to discard spurious sinusoids that have been estimated. There are two functions in `sineModel.py` that together perform sine tracking. The function `sineTracking()` tracks peaks from one frame to the next, to give tracks of the sinusoids in time. The function `cleaningSineTracks()` then cleans up the tracks by discarding short spurious sinusoids based on a length threshold. These functions use the following parameters to do sine tracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `maxnSines`: Maximum number of sines tracked per frame.\n",
    "2. `minSineDur`: Minimum duration of a sinusoidal track in seconds.\n",
    "3. `freqDevOffset`: The minimum frequency deviation at 0Hz. Since the frequency of sinusoidal tracks can change slowly over time, it is necessary to have a margin of allowed deviation to track the change over time. \n",
    "4. `freqDevSlope`: Slope increase of minimum frequency deviation. The common deviations are  more pronounced at higher frequency and we compensate for that using a scaling factor, which provides a higher deviation allowance at higher frequencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we set `minSineDur = 0`, it retains all the spectral peaks detected. `maxnSines` can be set according to our prior knowledge about the number of sinusoids present in the signal. `freqDevOffset` intuitively can be set to be the minimum distance between two consecutive sinusoids (or harmonics in the case of harmonic sounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tracking low amplitude sinusoids:__\n",
    "Tracking sinusoids of low amplitude among other sinusoids of high amplitude presents several challenges. In a signal that has two sinusoidal components with a very large difference in their amplitude, the analysis window we use is critical. If we use a window that has high sidelobe levels, the mainlobe of the sinusoid with low amplitude might get buried under the sidelobes of the dominant high amplitude sinusoid. When the amplitude difference is huge you need to choose a window that will ensure that the sidelobe levels of the louder sinusoid is lower than the mainlobe level of the softer sinusoid. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Using Phase to track sinusoid peaks:__\n",
    "Zero-phase windowing a sinusoidal signal leads to a phase spectrum that is flat around the bins corresponding to the frequency of the sinusoid. This property of flatness of the phase spectrum can be used to identify and track sinusoidal peaks. This can be an alternative, or a complementary way to the identification of sinusoids by just measuring local maxima in the magnitude spectrum. We can pick local maxima in the magnitude spectrum and also measure the variance of the phase spectrum around the local maximum to select or discard a particular spectral peak. However, it is to be noted that this condition of flatness is satisfied only when the sinusoid is not time varying. For strongly time-varying sinusoids, the condition fails. "

    "\n",
    "The function `min_freq_est_err()` should estimate the frequency of a sinusoidal signal at a given time instant. The \n",
    "function should return the estimated frequency in Hz, together with the window size and the FFT size used in the analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The input arguments to the function are the wav file name including the path (`input_file`) containing the sinusoidal signal, and the frequency of the sinusoid in Hz (`f`). The frequency of the input sinusoid can range between 100Hz and 2000Hz. The function should return a three element tuple of the estimated frequency of the sinusoid (`f_est`), the window size (`M`), and the FFT size (`N`) used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input wav file should be a stationary audio signal consisting of a single sinusoid of length >=1 second. Since the signal is stationary you can just perform the analysis of a single frame, for example in the middle of the sound file (time equal to .5 seconds). The analysis process would be to first select a fragment of the signal equal to the window size, `M`, centered at .5 seconds, then compute the DFT using the `dftAnal()` function, and finally use the `peakDetection()` and `peakInterp()` functions to obtain the frequency value of the sinusoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a Blackman window for analysis and a magnitude threshold `t = -40`dB for peak picking. The window size and FFT size should be chosen such that the difference between the true frequency (`f`) and the estimated frequency (`fEst`) is less than 0.05 Hz for the entire allowed frequency range of the input sinusoid. The window size should be the minimum positive integer of the form `100*k + 1` (where `k` is a positive integer) for which the frequency estimation error is < 0.05Hz. For a window size `M`, take the FFT size (`N`) to be the smallest power of 2 larger than `M`. \n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: Computing `M` theoritically using a formula might be complex in such cases. Instead, you need to \n",
    "follow a heuristic approach to determine the optimal value of `M` and `N` for a particular `f`. You can iterate\n",

    "This is an open question without a single specific answer. We will use the sound `multiSines.wav`, which is a synthetic audio signal with sharp attacks, close frequency components with a wide range of amplitudes, and time varying chirps with frequency tracks that cross over. All these characteristics make this signal difficult to analyze with `sineModelAnal()`. Get familiar with the signal by listening to it and visualizing its spectrogram. Use `models_GUI.py` interface or Sonic Visualizer to see its spectrogram. \n",

    "We have written a basic code for sinusoidal analysis, you are free to modify it. You should be able to generate a sound that is perceptually undistinguishable from the input sound.\n"
