    "# Exercise 9: Sound and music description\n",
    "\n",
    "With this exercise you will learn to describe sounds with simple machine learning methods. You will learn to use the Freesound API to load pre-computed sound descriptors from Freesound and to perform sound clustering and classification with them. You will work with instrumental sounds, thus learning what audio features are useful for characterizing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four parts in this exercise: 1) Download sounds and descriptors from Freesound, 2) Select two descriptors for a good sound clustering, 3) Cluster sounds using k-means, and 4) Classify sounds using k-NN.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide the code for each task, thus no need to get involved in much programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Freesound API\n",
    "With the Freesound API you can browse, search, and retrieve information from Freesound, such as automatically extracted features from audio files. You can also perform advanced queries combining content analysis features and other metadata (tags, etc...). With the API you can do text searches similar to what you can do from the advance searches in the website http://freesound.org/search/?q, but implementing the the queries in software. If you are interested in knowing more about the Freesound API, you can see examples of using it with python in: https://github.com/MTG/freesound-python/blob/master/examples.py and you can read the API documentation, http://www.freesound.org/docs/api/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sound descriptors\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use sound descriptors that have been pre-computed with Essentia, https://essentia.upf.edu and are stored in the Freesound database together with the corresponding sounds. Many sound descriptors can be extracted using Essentia (http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/algorithms_reference.html) and in Freesound, a number of them are used. In the Freesound API documentation there is specifc information of the descriptors available in Freesound, https://freesound.org/docs/api/analysis_index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidian distance\n",
    "The Euclidian distance is the straight-line distance between two points in an n-dimensional space, thus the distance between points $p$ and $q$ is the length of the line segment connecting them. If $p = (p_1, p_2,..., p_n)$ and $q = (q_1, q_2,..., q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance, $d$, from $p$ to $q$, or from $q$ to $p$ is given by the Pythagorean formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ d(p,q) = \\sqrt{\\sum^n_{i=1} (q_i - p_i)^2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-means clustering (k-means)\n",
    "K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. K-means clustering aims to partition $n$ observations into $k$ clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. The problem is computationally difficult (NP-hard), however, efficient heuristic algorithms converge quickly to a local optimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of observations $(x_1, x_2, …, x_n)$, where each observation is a d-dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to partition the $n$ observations into $k (≤ n)$ sets $S = {S_1, S_2, …, S_k}$ so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) (i.e. variance). Formally, the objective is to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\underset{\\mathbf{S}} {\\operatorname{arg\\,min}}  \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{\\mathbf x \\in S_i} \\left\\| \\mathbf x - \\boldsymbol\\mu_i \\right\\|^2 = \\underset{\\mathbf{S}} {\\operatorname{arg\\,min}}  \\sum_{i=1}^k |S_i| \\operatorname{Var} S_i$, where $μ_i$ is the mean of points in $S_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-nearest neighbours classifier (k-NN)\n",
    "K-nearest neighbours classification (k-NN) is a non-parametric method in which the input consists of the $k$ closest training examples in the feature space. The output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$ is a positive integer, typically small). If $k = 1$, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n"

    "## Part 1: Download sounds and descriptors from Freesound\n",
    "\n",
    "Download a collection of intrumental sounds and their descriptors from Freesound using the Freesound API.\n",
    "\n",
    "First get a Freesound API key from http://www.freesound.org/apiv2/apply/ and create a directory in the workspace with the name `testDownload` to store the sounds and descriptors. You also need to install the python client for the freesound API. Do this by cloning the repository https://github.com/MTG/freesound-python, into a folder and installing it following the instructions. You will have to import the freesound module in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be calling the function `download_sounds_freesound()` whose input parameters are:\n",
    "1. `queryText` (string): A single word or a string of words without spaces (use hyphens), typically the name of the instrument. e.g. (eg. \"violin\", \"trumpet\", \"cello\", \"bassoon\", etc.)\n",
    "2. `tag` (string): tag to be used for filtering the searched sounds (e.g., \"multisample\", \"single-note\", \"velocity\", \"tenuto\", etc.).\n",
    "3. `duration` (2 floating point numbers): min and max duration (seconds) of the sound to filter, e.g., (0.2,15).\n",
    "4. `API_Key` (string): your api key.\n",
    "5. `outputDir` (string): path to the directory where you want to store the sounds and their descriptors.\n",
    "6. `topNResults` (integer): number of results (sounds) that you want to download.\n",
    "7. `featureExt` (file extension): file extension for storing sound descriptor (.json, typically).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the call to `download_sounds_freesound()` you will have to choose the appropriate queryText, tag, and duration, to return single notes/strokes of instrumental sounds. The first twenty results of the query should be \"good\". Note that the tag can be empty. Example of a query to obtain single notes of violin could be: `download_sounds_freesound(queryText='violin', API_Key=<your key>, outputDir='testDownload/', topNResults=20, duration=(0,8.5), tag='single-note')`. This returns 20 single notes of violin sounds and the script stores them in the testDownload directory (the directory has to be created beforehand).\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and store twenty sound examples of each instrument using the `download_sounds_freesound()` function given below. The examples need to be representative of the instrument, single notes (melodic instruments) or single strokes (percussion instruments), and shorter than 10 seconds. Specify a good query text, tag, and duration to query for the chosen instruments. Refine your search parameters until you get twenty good samples for each instrument. Select three instruments to be used out of this set: violin, guitar, bassoon, trumpet, clarinet, cello, naobo (cymbals used in Beijing Opera). Listen to the sounds downloaded and look at the descriptor .json files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the API to download the sounds, we recommend to do the same query using the Freesound website and checking that the top 20 results are good."

    "## Part 3: Cluster sounds using k-means\n",
    "\n",
    "After visualizing the sound descriptors, you will now cluster the sounds using more than two descriptors. You can use as many descriptors as you need for the best clustering. Use the same set of sounds obtain in Task 1, starting from the descriptors that you found were good in Part 2, and then adding other descriptors that you feel can improve the kmeans clustering of sounds. The function `cluster_sounds()` takes the sounds folder (targetDir), number of clusters (nCluster) and the descriptor indices (descInput) as input. It then performs a kmeans clustering using the selected descriptors. Make sure that in targetDir you only have the 3 instruments chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part, you can use as many descriptors as you need to achieve good clustering and classification performance. However it is best to use as few descriptors as possible in order to make it easier to explain the contribution of each descriptor. Choose the number of clusters to be the same as the number of instruments (i.e., 3). Ideally in such a case, all the sounds of an instrument should go into a single cluster. In reality however, there might be sounds that are outliers and can go into a different cluster. The algorithm takes a majority vote on the sounds in each of the three clusters and assigns each cluster to an instrument. We compute the performance of the clustering by checking the number of points (sounds), that have been wrongly assigned to a cluster. The function clusterSounds() prints the clusters and the sounds assigned to each one. The function also prints the resulting classification obtained with the choice of descriptors you made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a short paragraph explaining the descriptors you used, the resulting classification accuracy you obtained, and your observations on why you obtained (or not) those errors in clustering. Comment if you see any systematic errors (such as a consistent mix up of sounds from two instruments) and possible reasons for that. You should also try to cluster with different subsets of descriptors and mention the classification accuracy you obtain in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Since the cluster centers are randomly initialized every time in k-means, you might see different results every time you run the function. You can report the best result you obtained."
